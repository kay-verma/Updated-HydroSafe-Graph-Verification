## Hydrostructure

hydrostructure.java is a program that calculates the hydrostructure of a specified walk in a strongly connected graph. The hydrostructure categorizes all nodes in the graph into four categories based on their reachability conditions: Cloud, Vapor, Sea, and River.

## Definitions:

R-(W): All nodes in the graph that can reach the end of the walk (end(W)) without using the start of the walk (start(W)).
R+(W): All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the start of the walk (start(W)) without using the end of the walk (end(W)).
Categories:

Cloud: Nodes in R-(W) that are not part of the Vapor category.
Vapor: Nodes that are present in both R+(W) and R-(W).
Sea: Nodes in R+(W) that are not part of the Vapor category.
River: All remaining nodes that are not in the Cloud, Vapor, or Sea categories.
The hydrostructure.png image provided illustrates the model, where the arrows represent the cases in which edge insertion is safe.

By analyzing the hydrostructure of a walk, you can verify the safety of the walk within the strongly connected graph.

Please note that the hydrostructure.java program should be appropriately compiled and executed with the required input to obtain the hydrostructure information.
